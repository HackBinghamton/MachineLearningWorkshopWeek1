# HackBU - Machine Learning Week 1!
### 6:30-8:00 PM October 16th, 2019 in UU 108

## Getting Started

Welcome to part one of our two-week machine learning series! This workshop will be a more traditional workshop - it will introduce various machine learning concepts and have you implement what you've learned on a real-world example. Part two will be more project-based, and there will be different tracks for those who are interested in different kinds of machine learning problems.

Today's workshop covers:
1. [Introduction to Machine Learning with scikit-learn](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/MachineLearningWorkshopWeek1/blob/master/intro_ml_scikit.ipynb)
2. [Introduction to Neural Networks with Tensorflow](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/MachineLearningWorkshopWeek1/blob/master/intro_neural_networks_tf.ipynb)
3. [Housing Price Prediction with Machine Learning](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/MachineLearningWorkshopWeek1/blob/master/housing_price_prediction.ipynb)


## Bug Bounties

If you find a bug or mistake in our workshop, let an organizer know or make a pull request fixing it! We'll be handing out special HackBU stickers to those who find bugs/mistakes, and as always, we'll be giving stickers away to some random respondents from our feedback form.
