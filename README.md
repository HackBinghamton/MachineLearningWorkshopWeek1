# HackBU - Machine Learning Week 1

## Getting Started

Welcome to part one of our two-week machine learning series! Week 1 will be a in the style of a traditional workshop: it will introduce various machine learning concepts and have you implement what you've learned on a real-world example. Week 2 will be more project-based, and there will be different tracks for those who are interested in different kinds of machine learning problems.

Today's workshop covers:
1. [Introduction to Machine Learning with scikit-learn](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/MachineLearningWorkshopWeek1/blob/master/intro_ml_scikit.ipynb)
2. [Introduction to Neural Networks with Tensorflow](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/MachineLearningWorkshopWeek1/blob/master/intro_neural_networks_tf.ipynb)
3. [Housing Price Prediction with Machine Learning](https://colab.research.google.com/github/HackBinghamton/MachineLearningWorkshopWeek1/blob/master/housing_price_prediction.ipynb)

## Bug Bounties

If you find a bug or mistake in our workshop, let an organizer know or [make a pull request](https://github.com/HackBinghamton/IntroToProgrammingWorkshop/blob/master/making_a_pull_request.md) fixing it! We'll be giving out special HackBU stickers to those who find bugs/mistakes.
